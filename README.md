# F1 Qualifying Telemetry Simulator

A silly little script that creates animated visualizations comparing telemetry data from the top 3 drivers in Q3. Provides sector-by-sector dominance analysis with dynamic track visualization and telemetry plots.

## Features

### üèéÔ∏è **Real-Time Animation**
- Animated representations of cars moving around the track layout
- Dynamic telemetry traces that build progressively
- Sector dominance visualization with color-coded track segments

### üìä **Telemetry Analysis**
- **Speed Analysis**: Compare speed profiles throughout the lap
- **Throttle Data**: Visualize acceleration zones and driving styles
- **Brake Analysis**: Identify braking points and techniques
- **Track Dominance**: See which driver is fastest in each sector

### üé® **Visualization**
- Automatic track layout optimization and rotation
- Official team colors for each driver (hard coded because I don't like FastF1's color selection. Idc if it isn't optimal)
- Dynamic z-ordering to highlight dominant drivers
- Multi-panel dashboard with synchronized data

### üèÅ **Race Weekend Integration**
- Supports any F1 season and race weekend
- Automatic data fetching from official timing systems
- Top 3 Q3 drivers automatically selected
- Lap time formatting and position display

## Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install fastf1 pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### Dependencies
- **FastF1**: Official F1 timing data access
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and animation

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/j5t3313/telemetryAnimation.git]
cd f1-qualifying-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the simulator:
```bash
python qualiTelSimv2.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Run with default settings (2025 Monza Grand Prix):
```python
from qualiTelSimv2 import F1LaptimeSimulatorLayeredDominance

simulator = F1LaptimeSimulatorLayeredDominance()
animation = simulator.run_simulation()
```

### Custom Race Selection
```python
# 2024 Monaco Grand Prix
animation = simulator.run_simulation(year=2024, round_num=8)

# 2023 British Grand Prix  
animation = simulator.run_simulation(year=2023, round_num=10)
```

### Understanding the Output

The simulator creates a 2x2 dashboard with:

1. **Track Dominance** (Top Left): Shows the actual track layout with color-coded sectors indicating which driver was fastest in each section
2. **Speed Profile** (Top Right): Speed vs distance comparison for all three drivers
3. **Throttle Input** (Bottom Left): Throttle percentage throughout the lap
4. **Brake Input** (Bottom Right): Braking intensity and points

## How It Works

### Data Processing
1. **Data Acquisition**: Uses FastF1 to fetch official F1 timing data
2. **Driver Selection**: Automatically identifies top 3 Q3 performers
3. **Telemetry Processing**: Extracts speed, throttle, brake, and position data
4. **Track Optimization**: Rotates track layout for optimal viewing

### Animation System
- **Sector Analysis**: Divides lap into 100 sectors for granular dominance calculation
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Updates car positions and telemetry traces in real-time
- **Z-Order Management**: Brings dominant driver's data to the foreground
- **Color Coding**: Uses team colors for easy identification

### Technical Features
- **Automatic Caching**: Speeds up subsequent runs for the same race
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing data or connection issues
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient data structures for smooth animation
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Configuration

### Customizable Parameters

```python
# Animation speed (milliseconds between frames)
interval=75  # Default: 75ms

# Number of sectors for dominance analysis
num_sectors=100  # Default: 100 sectors

# Track optimization settings
track_padding=0.1  # Visual padding around track
```

### Color Scheme
The simulator uses colors I picked:
- McLaren: Orange (#FF8700) and Blue (#FFD580)
- Red Bull: Navy (#23326A)
- Mercedes: Cyan (#24ffff)
- Ferrari: Red (#dc0000)
- And more...

## Performance Tips

1. **First Run**: Initial data download may take time - cached for subsequent runs
2. **System Resources**: Close other applications for smoother animation
3. **Data Quality**: Some sessions may have limited telemetry data. F1's public data stream is very low-resolution. 

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No data available"**
- Check if the race weekend has occurred
- Verify qualifying session took place
- Some historical races may have limited data

**Animation lag**
- Reduce `num_sectors` parameter
- Increase `interval` time
- Close other resource-intensive applications

**Import errors**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install fastf1 pandas numpy matplotlib`
- Check Python version compatibility (3.7+)
